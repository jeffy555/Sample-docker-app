Satan wants to put his idealogy to Eve. He wanted to force Eve to do the same mistake that he did in Heaven. The Mistake (To became God himself). 
As we see in Genesis 4:1 – Only with the help of God I have brought forth a Man. So God helped Eve to bring Cain to this world
Genesis 4:1
1 - ஆதாம் தன் மனைவியாகிய ஏவாளை அறிந்தான்; அவள் கர்ப்பவதியாகி, காயீனைப் பெற்று, கர்த்தரால் ஒரு மனுஷனைப் பெற்றேன் என்றாள்.
  English:- Adam Lay With His Wife Eve, And She Became Pregnant And Gave Birth To Cain. She Said, "With The Help Of The Lord I Have Brought Forth A Man."
The word Cain meaning – Ive Got him / Here he is.
Eve gave the name “Cain” – Because in the previous chapter God gave a confirmation to Eve saying – Genesis 3:15 
Genesis 3:15
15 - உனக்கும் ஸ்திரீக்கும், உன் வித்துக்கும் அவள் வித்துக்கும் பகை உண்டாக்குவேன்; அவர் உன் தலையை நசுக்குவார், நீ அவர் குதிங்காலை நசுக்குவாய் என்றார்.
English:- And I Will Put Enmity Between You And The Woman, And Between Your Offspring And Hers; He Will Crush Your Head, And You Will Strike His Heel."
This is not Cain striking the Snake – Cain itself an Evil one. As depicted in 1 John 3:12
1 John 3:12
12 - பொல்லாங்கனால் உண்டாயிருந்து தன் சகோதரனைக் கொலைசெய்த காயீனைப்போலிருக்கவேண்டாம்; அவன் எதினிமித்தம் அவனைக் கொலைசெய்தான்? தன் கிரியைகள் பொல்லாதவைகளும், தன் சகோதரனுடைய கிரியைகள் நீதியுள்ளவைகளுமாயிருந்ததினிமித்தந்தானே.
English:- Do Not Be Like Cain, Who Belonged To The Evil One And Murdered His Brother. And Why Did He Murder Him? Because His Own Actions Were Evil And His Brother's Were Righteous.
Cain – He was the evil one (this is not the promised seed)
Abel – (Murdered by Cain)
Seth – (Promised seed)
Through Seth – Came – Abharam – (2 sons) 
Abharam – Issac – Ishmaiel 
Issac – Promised seed
Issac – Twins (Esa and Jacob) Esa was the first son but the promised seed is Jacob
Jacob has 12 sons
We would have thought Joseph to be promised seed but its not. Joseph was chosen to protect the promised seed. Benjamin is also not the promised seed.
Judah is the promised seed(4th son of Jacob)
Judah as in Genesis 44:18-34 (He said it will kill his father when asked to bring Benjamin)
Interestingly, He offers himself in place of the boy
Genesis 44:33 
 “Now then, please let your servant remain here as my lord’s slave in place of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
33 - இப்படியிருக்க, இளையவன் தன் சகோதரரோடேகூடப் போகவிடும்படி மன்றாடுகிறேன்; உம்முடைய அடியானாகிய நான் இளையவனுக்குப் பதிலாக இங்கே என் ஆண்டவனுக்கு அடிமையாயிருக்கிறேன்.
Judah confirmed and proclaimed the character of the promised seed.
From Judah we see the lineage goes to David through
Judah – Perez – Hezron – Ram – Amminadab – Nahshon – Salmon - Boaz – Obed – Jesse – King David
David represents himself as Israel Champions
David offered himself as the sacrifice like Judah did.
Who Planned the plot to put Jospeh to Egypt – Its Judah
26 - அப்பொழுது யூதா தன் சகோதரரை நோக்கி: நாம் நம்முடைய சகோதரனைக் கொன்று, அவன் இரத்தத்தை மறைப்பதினால் லாபம் என்ன?
27 - அவனை இந்த இஸ்மவேலருக்கு விற்றுப்போடுவோம் வாருங்கள்; நமது கை அவன்மேல் படாதிருப்பதாக; அவன் நம்முடைய 
English:- Judah Said To His Brothers, "What Will We Gain If We Kill Our Brother And Cover Up His Blood?

சகோதரனும் நம்முடைய மாம்சமுமாய் இருக்கிறானே என்றான். அவன் சகோதரர் அவன் சொல்லுக்கு இணங்கினார்கள்.
English:- Come, Let's Sell Him To The Ishmaelites And Not Lay Our Hands On Him; After All, He Is Our Brother, Our Own Flesh And Blood." His Brothers Agreed.
Every last bit of this is necessary – Joseph getting sold to Egypt (Judah saving Joseph by selling him instead of killing. Joseph going to prison for the crime he didn’t commit. Joseph becoming the leader and Judah asking for the sacrifice in place of Benjamin. David coming to be battle sacrificing himself for Israel)
All these are necessary for Jesus to come to save his people
Questions to be clarified?
When Cain was born and When Seth was born?
Cain Married his sister? When Cain travelled to Nod?
Where Cain meet his wife? 
Cain’s wife came to Nod?
So what was the mark given to Cain? Technically If he is afraid of others who are the others? Because as per the Bible there are only 3 members - (Adam Eve Cain Not able) so Who Cain got afraid of? Is he afraid of the Fallen Angels? 
Adam and Eve might still have daughters, but Cain should not be afraid of his own people.
Bible clearly mentioned:
Genesis 5:4: “Adam had other sons and daughters.”
So Cain would have feared his own family. (many daughters and Sons)
Cain’s lineage is corrupted with [Violence, Rebellion, Wordly acheivements] and also they come with some postivies for their own traits like [Building Cities, Developing arts, technology]. 
Interestingly, Genesis 6:1,2 says:
1 - மனுஷர் பூமியின்மேல் பெருகத் துவக்கி, அவர்களுக்குக் குமாரத்திகள் பிறந்தபோது:

English:- When Men Began To Increase In Number On The Earth And Daughters Were Born To Them,
2 - தேவகுமாரர் மனுஷகுமாரத்திகளை அதிக சௌந்தரியமுள்ளவர்களென்று கண்டு, அவர்களுக்குள்ளே தங்களுக்குப் பெண்களைத் தெரிந்துகொண்டார்கள்.
English:- The Sons Of God Saw That The Daughters Of Men Were Beautiful, And They Married Any Of Them They Chose.
Genesis 5 – Tells the lineage from Adam to Noah
Genesis 6:1,2 – Tells the Watcher corrupting the Women
If Seth’s lineage is the blessed seed and Cain’s lineage is the corrupted seed, then it is reasonable to see the Nephilim as arising from Cain’s descendants. Although the Bible does not explicitly mention Adam and Eve’s other sons and daughters in this context, there is a probability that the Nephilim could have come from them as well. However, Scripture clearly portrays Cain’s line as corrupted, and since the fallen angels (Watchers) were themselves corrupted and cast down from heaven, it is consistent to suggest that Cain’s lineage and the fallen angels joined together, producing a line marked by rebellion and violence.
